## Commit messages

These instructions are only relevant when writing commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line of the commit message short
- If you are using a commit message to close an issue, use the phrase "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123" (where 123 is the issue number)
- Start the commit message with a prefix (e.g. "Deps: Install...", "Assets: Add...").
- Use "Docs:" prefix for documentation changes.
- Use "Tests:" prefix for test changes.
- Use the module name as the prefix for changes to schema or context modules (e.g. "Auth:").
- Use "CI:" prefix for changes to CI/CD configuration.
- Use "Assets:" prefix for any changes made to files in the assets folder.
- Use "Deps:" prefix for changes to dependencies.
- Use the feature name as the prefix for changes to ZoonkWeb (e.g. "Login:").
- Use "i18n:" prefix for changes to translations.
- If unsure what prefix to use, use the folder name as the prefix (e.g. "Config:").
- Avoid using things like "Refactor:" or "Update:" as the prefix, instead use a more specific prefix.
